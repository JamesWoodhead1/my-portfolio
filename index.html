    <h2>My background</h2>
    <p>Early in life I aspired to be a scientist, which led to me going to university to study Cell Biology. <span>
        After university I was inspired by the NHS and trying to help people. This led to a job at Salford Royal working in microbiology processing all of the general publics most disgusting samples.
    </span>I've always been interested in computers, especially taking them apart and putting them back together. Having built my first PC, i decided the next step would be to learn how to speak to computers<span>
        Thats when I decided to learn how to code!
